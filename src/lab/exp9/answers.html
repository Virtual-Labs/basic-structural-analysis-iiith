		<p>A.1 Retaining walls are relatively rigid walls used for supporting the soil mass laterally so that the soil can be retained at different levels on the two sides. Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope).</p><br>

		<p>A.2 Lateral earth pressure is the pressure that soil exerts in the horizontal direction. The lateral earth pressure is important because it affects the consolidation behavior and strength of the soil and because it is considered in the design of geotechnical engineering structures such as retaining walls, basements, tunnels, deep foundations and braced excavations.</p><br>

		<p>A.3 It is a stress field solution that predicts active and passive earth pressure. It assumes that the soil is cohesionless, the wall is frictionless, the soil-wall interface is vertical, the failure surface on which the soil moves is planar, and the resultant force is angled parallel to the backfill surface.</p><br>

		<p>A.4 The mass of soil in the backfill above safe/stable slope is unstable and it tends to slide as the wall moves away or toward the backfill. Coulomb stated that this wedge of soil moves outward (away from the backfill) and downward in the active case when the wall moves away from the backfill.</p><br>
