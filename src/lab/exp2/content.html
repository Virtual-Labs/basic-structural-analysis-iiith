            A beam is a structural element that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. The bending force induced into the material of the beam as a result of the external loads, own weight and external reactions to these loads is called a bending moment. Beams generally carry vertical gravitational forces but can also be used to carry horizontal loads (i.e., loads due to an earthquake or wind). The loads carried by a beam are transferred to columns, walls, or girders, which then transfer the force to adjacent structural compression members. In Light frame construction the joists rest on the beam. 
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
            Beams are characterized by their profile (the shape of their cross-section), their length, and their material. In contemporary construction, beams are typically made of steel, reinforced concrete, or wood. One of the most common types of steel beam is the I-beam or wide-flange beam (also known as a "universal beam" or, for stouter sections, a "universal column"). This is commonly used in steel-frame buildings and bridges. Other common beam profiles are the C-channel, the hollow structural section beam, the pipe, and the angle.

          In General when the beam is subject to the loading it deflects, some of the moments and reactions occur in that beam. By determining the loads in the member at particular distance the bending moment and shear force can be calculated. <br>
<strong>Shear Force:</strong> Shear force is an internal force in any material which is usually caused by any external force acting tangent (perpendicular) to the material axis, or a force which has a component acting tangent to the material axis. <br>
<strong>Bending Moment:</strong> Bending moment is the algebraic sum of moments to the left or right of the section. In each case, by considering, either for forces or moments the resultants caused by applied forces to one side of the section is balanced by bending moment and shear force acting on the section. <br>

c. Micrometer<br>
d. Ruler<br>
e. Dial Gauges<br><br>
<strong>PROCEDURE</strong><br>
<strong>A. SIMPLY SUPPORTED BEAM</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>
Record the beam dimensions and calculate the area moment of inertia (I) using:     
I = bh3/12</li>
<li>Calculate the maximum permissible loads for mid-span and quarter-span loading using Equation 1.3, where maximum allowable stress is 18,000 psi.</li>
<li>Load the beam at the mid-span in 5 lb. increments, until the maximum load limit is reached.  Record the deflection at the point of loading at each incremental load. Small divisions on the dial gage are 0.001 inch. One full revolution of the dial is 0.1 inch (100 small divisions).</li>
<li>Repeat the above procedure at the quarter-span.</li>
</ul><br>
<strong>B. CANTILEVER BEAM</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>
Record the beam dimensions and calculate the area moment of inertia (I) using:     
I = bh3/12</li>
<li>Calculate the safe loads at the mid-span and end of the cantilever beam using Equation Sigmamax= Mc/I (where M = moment at the section, I = moment of inertia), and a maximum allowable stress of 18,000 psi.</li>
<li>Load the beam at the mid-span in 2 lb. increments, until the maximum load limit is reached.  Record the deflection at the point of loading at each increment.</li>
<li>Repeat the Repeat the above procedure at the free end of the beam. Care must be taken so that the displacement does not exceed the maximum travel of the dial gage.</li>
